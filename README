This ICal module is a perl binding to libical, a C language
implemention of the iCalendar calendaring and scheduling
protocols. The iCalendar data units and protocols permit users to
store and retrieve calendar data on remote servers and to schedule
events with other calendar users. The protocols are specified in
RFC 2445, RFC 2446 , RFC 2447 and two IETF drafts. For more
information, see the working group's web page at:

REQUIREMENTS

1) libical
2) SWIG

INSTALLATION

First, you will need to install libical. You can get this from
http://softwarestudio.org/libical/index.html.

Next, edit the Makefile.PL to refer to the lib and include directories
where you installed libical.

Finally, make the perl distribution as normal.

USE

This release is an early alpha and is really only useful to the
hard-core calendar hacker. You should be familar with libical, and you
will have to rely on the code in the test directory for documentation.
